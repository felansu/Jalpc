DEV DEPENDENCIES
----------------
webpack
webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

webpack-dev-server
Use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. This should be used for development only.
It uses webpack-dev-middleware under the hood, which provides fast in-memory access to the webpack assets.

babel-cli
Babel command line.
In addition, various entry point scripts live in the top-level package at babel-cli/bin.
There are some shell-executable utility scripts, babel-external-helpers.js and babel-node.js, and the main Babel cli script, babel.js.

babel-loader
This package allows transpiling JavaScript files using Babel and webpack.

babel-core
Babel compiler core.

babel-preset-es2015
Babel preset for all es2015 plugins.
"A preset is a set of plugins used to support particular language features."

babel-preset-react
Babel preset for all React plugins.

babel-preset-stage-2
Babel preset for stage 2 plugins.

stage-0 - Strawman: just an idea, possible Babel plugin.
stage-1 - Proposal: this is worth working on.
> stage-2 - Draft: initial spec. A first version of what will be in the specification. At this point, an eventual inclusion of the feature in the standard is likely.
stage-3 - Candidate: complete spec and initial browser implementations.
stage-4 - Finished: will be added to the next yearly release.
